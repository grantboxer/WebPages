		<h1>About Grant Boxer</h1>

		<p>I am a professional geologist with about 40 years experience in mineral exploration, mainly in diamond exploration and mining. I am a Registered Professional in Mineral Exploration with the AIG (Australasian Institute of Geoscientists), a member of the Geological Society of Australia and the Meteoritical Association.</p>
		<br>
		<p>My interests also include astronomy, meteorites and meteorite impacts and astro-imaging (astrophotography).</p>
		<p>I have worked in exploration and mining geology since finishing my studies in 1973 at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Victoria, Australia.  The past 40 years have been spent mainly in the diamond industry undertaking exploration, evaluation, bulk sampling and mining activities.  I was employed by Rio Tinto (CRA Exploration Pty Ltd and Argyle Diamonds) from 1978 until 1997, and during this time, spent 10 years located at the Argyle mine undertaking exploration, evaluation programs, feasibility studies and mine development of the Argyle diamond mine and associated alluvial deposits. This work included the design, supervision and analysis of bulk sampling programmes and the analysis of diamond size distributions in exploration, evaluation and mining operations on both pipe and alluvial deposits.</p>
		<p>In the period 1993 until late 1997, I was engaged in diamond, nickel and gold exploration with Rio Tinto Exploration, based in Perth, which also included the use of MapInfo and Discover GIS packages for the compilation of geological, geophysical and remote sensing data sets.</p>

		<p>From 1998 until mid-2002, I was employed by Astro Mining NL and Quantum Resources Limited, undertaking project reviews, field visits, project management and project generation for diamonds in Western Australia, Northern Territory and China.  Activities included exploration on areas adjacent to the Argyle diamond mine, including the adjacent alluvial diamond Bow River Mine area, in the far north of WA and pipe exploration on tenements held in the Northern Territory.</p>

		<p>Since 2002, I have been consulting to the world wide diamond exploration and mining industry, with clients involved in diamond exploration in Australia, Brazil, China, Tanzania and India. Consulting activities range from grass roots exploration programme planning, through diamond project opportunity reviews to the analysis of exploration and evaluation diamond data. </p>

		<p>Since early 2007, G Boxer has also been involved with the exploration and evaluation of CID, BIF and supergene iron ore deposits in the Pilbara and Yilgarn regions, manganese projects in the East Kimberley and a graphite project in Western Australia. Diamond exploration was undertaken in India and Western Australia. Other activities also included Microsoft Access database maintenance, GIS data compilations for project generation in various parts of the world and running workshops on the use of QGIS in mineral exploration.</P><br>
